# Lex-Bot-with-Lamda-Function
As a digital transformation consultant by one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country, I have been asked to help increase their client portfolioâ€”especially by engaging young people. Because machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve the customer experience, I have decide to create a robo advisor. Both existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.
I have created a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement via AWS Lex and Lambda.
